        overview: >
          This set of tests retrieves information about the supported capabilities and relevant endpoints of the server.
          Requests for information from the `/metadata` and `/.well-known/smart-configuration` endpoints are made to get
          information about supported capabilities and authorization endpoints.

        overview: >
          These tests are primarily based on exercising the [SMART App Launch Framework](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/index.html).
          App Registration is typically done first and can be done Manually or Dynamically and as either a public or confidential client.
          The app can then be launched as either a standalone a standalone app or from the EHR.
          There are also tests for validating OAuth 2.0 id or refresh tokens if provided.

      - name: Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide
        overview: >
          For each of the relevant USCDI data elements provided in the conformance statement, these test execute the [required supported searches](http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/Conformance-server.html)
          as defined by the Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide.  The test defaults to using the Patient provided in the most recent SMART App Launch performed by Inferno.
          The tests will perform searches and reads for the Resource selected and validate the response against the
          relevant [profile](http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/profiles.html) as currently defined in the Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide.
