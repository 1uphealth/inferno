      - name: Discovery and Registration
        overview: |
          Demonstrate the server's ability to provide required service metatdata through the discovery endpoints, including OAuth endpoints,
          supported resources and searches.  If the server provides a dynamic registration endpoint, this will attempt to register Inferno's
          test application.  Otherwise, the user must demonstrate the ability to manually register the application.

      - name: Standalone Patient App Launch
        overview: |
          Demonstrate the ability to support launching SMART on FHIR apps that are authorized to access a single patient using the standalone launch sequence.
        sequences:
          - sequence: StandaloneLaunchSequence
            title: Standalone Launch with Patient Scope
            description: Perform SMART launch sequence.  Patient, OpenID Connect and Token Refresh scopes required.
          - sequence: ArgonautPatientSequence
            title: Read Patient Resource
            description: Demonstrate successful authorization by reading Patient resource.
      - name: EHR Practitioner App Launch
        overview: >
          Demonstrate the ability for an external launch with a user-level scope that is capable of accessing multiple patients.  This test requires the system to
          access multiple patient endpoints to demonstrate that a 3rd party app can interact with multiple patients without requiring re-authentication.
          Note that this is not the same as the Population-level API, which requires the ability for transfering much larger quantities of data in a more efficient manner.

          Demonstrate OpenID Connect
        sequences:
          - sequence: OpenIDConnectSequence
            title: Single Sign on using OpenID Connect
            description: Use OpenID Connect ID token provided during launch sequence to authenticate user.
